                        <br><br>
                        Born in McAlester, Oklahoma, I was a "military brat."
                        Moved to Sindai, Japan, then Tokyo, then Yokahoma, Japan, then Fort Bragg, NC, then Trieste,
                        Italy, then Heidelberg, Germany, then to Goldsboro, NC, then Charlotte, NC, then finally
                        Chapel Hill, NC. Then I moved to Washington DC, and then back to Oklahoma, where I met and
                        married my husband in Oklahoma City at Oklahoma City University. We moved to Fayetteville,
                        GA, where we had 2 beautiful children, one adopted from Korea. Then 20 years later, we adopted
                        two
                        baby girls from Vietnam.
                        <br><br>
                        From there, only 40 years after leaving Chapel Hill, I moved back to Chapel Hill, and we are
                        here to stay. Go Heels!

                        Sometimes I hold back a doll or two, hoping they might not sell because there's still a lot of
                        "little girl" in me. I sometimes say to people, "Buy a doll for your little girl or the little
                        girl in you," so I guess I have a lifelong interest in dolls.
                        <br><br>
                        In October 1997, I decided to turn my hobby into a business. I opened The Good Bunny Doll Shop
                        in Fayetteville, Georgia, the only specialty doll shop south of Marietta. Notable designers
                        include those by Madame Alexander, Annette Himstedt, Raikes
                        Bears, Steiff, Julie Good-Kruger, Dakin, Wendy Lofton and Corolle.
                        <br><br>
                        My selection of dolls, assorted fuzzy things, and actual "work of art" creations, is so
                        varied, there is something for everyone. Doll collectors may be particular about their
                        selections, almost every one I sell I keep thinking, "Oh, that was the one I was going to keep."
                        Each doll is just so special to me.

                        The Good Bunny Doll Shop was featured in The Fayette Citizen News, an article written 26 years
                        ago (1998) when I had a brick and mortar doll shop in Fayetteville, Georgia. We closed up the
                        shop in 2003 when I went to Vietnam to adopt 2 little baby girls. One is now working at the YMCA
                        while the other is finishing up her senior year in college.
                        <br><br>
                        The reporter made a small error when she
                        said I carried the American Girl Doll. They were only available mail order then, but I did have
                        a lot of wonderful handmade clothes and furniture for them. I loved having the shop then, but
                        taking care of babies was even more fun, even though I was 55 and my sweet husband was 63 when
                        we adopted them!
